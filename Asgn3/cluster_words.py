# Word clustering using k-means, using spacy's vector representations of words,
# which are 300-dimensional GloVe vectors trained on the Common Crawl; see https://spacy.io/models/en
# and https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. This function:
#   Converts a list of words into a list of vectors using the spacy nlp object
#   Does k-means clustering to generate numclusters clusters
#   Returns a dictionary that maps from numeric cluster label to the list of words in that cluster
#
# Note: this function silently ignores words that don't have a vector representation in spacy.
#
# See https://github.com/danielwilentz/Cuisine-Classifier/blob/master/topic_modeling/clustering.ipynb
# for an example of clustering that uses word2vec vectors, which you can find online by searching
# for GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin. That example also illustrates a common manual method for
# deciding on how many clusters to use.
