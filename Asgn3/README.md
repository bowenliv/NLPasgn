## Exploring syntactic analysis

The assignment is [here](../../../Dropbox/Study/UMD/641_NLP/HW3/assignment3/parsing_problems.pdf). Do parsing problems 1 and 2.

You are also welcome to do optional extra credit, which makes use of code in this repository.

This assignment is due Tuesday March 1 11:59pm ET.  This is not a long assignment, but given that the midterm is being handed out on Thursday March 3rd, I strongly recommend getting an early start and turning it in on time if at all possible.
