# Inputs:
#    X - a sequence of raw text strings to be processed
#    analyzefn - either built-in (see CountVectorizer documentation), or a function we provide from strings to feature-lists
#
#    Arguments used by the words analyzer
#      stopwords - set of stopwords (used by "word" analyzer")
#      lowercase - true if normalizing by lowercasing
#      ngram_range - (N,M) for using ngrams of sizes N up to M as features, e.g. (1,2) for unigrams and bigrams
#
#  Outputs:
#     X_features - corresponding feature vector for each raw text item in X
#     training_vectorizer - vectorizer object that can now be applied to some new X', e.g. containing test texts
#    
# You can find documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html
# and there's a nice, readable discussion at https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-count-vectorizer-5dd71530c1b
